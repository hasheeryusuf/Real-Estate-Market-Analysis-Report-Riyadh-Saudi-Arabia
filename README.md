## 💡 **Insights & Strategic Implications**

1. **East Riyadh = High Supply Zone:** Developers may focus on buyer conversion and marketing in this saturated area.
2. **South Riyadh = Opportunity Zone:** With lowest prices and limited supply, it’s prime for investment and urban development.
3. **Al-Mansourah = High-Demand Neighborhood:** Recommend developing mid-size family apartments here.
4. **Size Preference = Mid-Segment:** Apartments around 129–168 sqm match the sweet spot for buyers—optimize designs accordingly.
5. **Elevator Access = Near Balance:** Yet in high-density buildings, elevator installation should be prioritized.
6. **Furnishing Strategy:** A 50-50 furnished/unfurnished mix means marketing must cater to both local buyers and expats.
7. **Bedroom Gap:** The shortage of 3-bedroom apartments indicates unmet demand for flexible family housing.
8. **Luxury Market in the North:** The North region should be positioned as a premium zone for high-end buyers.
